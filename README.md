# Installation

https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts

```plain
(root)$ fish install
```

Script can be called from anywhere and installs the config
globally in `/etc/fish`. The old config is backed up first.

Optimally copy `fish_variables.default` to the users home
directory `~/.config/fish/fish_variables` for matching colors.

# Update

Just do a `git pull` and `exec fish`. That's it :)
